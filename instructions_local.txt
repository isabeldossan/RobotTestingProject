üîç Running Tests Locally
To run the test suite locally, you need to follow these steps:

‚úÖ Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.7+  - install via web, make sure to set PATH when installing
pip package  - install via web  
*Robot Framework  - install via command:  pip install robotframework
Selenium  - install via command:  pip install selenium
AppiumLibrary  - install via command:  pip install robotframework-AppiumLibrary
Node.js  - install via web 
Appium Server  - install via command:  npm install Appium
Appium Python Client  - install via command: pip install Appium-Python-Client
Android Emulator  - setup via Android Studio > More Actions > Virtual Device Manager > Choose one or more devices in the list
IDE (if editing in the files) like VS Code or Visual Studio

Check if everything was sucessful via (new) command-window:  pip list
Also possible to check if installations was sucessful via command:  python --version / robot --version , etc
Check if/which emulator exists via command:  emulator -list-avds
All dependencies listed in Requirements.txt.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Suite locally

If running locally make sure that the CustomizedKeywords points to the right .apk file (in variables) and that the path to the emulator in the .bat file 
is the right path to where your emulator/sdk is. You can change variables/testdata to other email, password etc. 

Double-tap the .bat file from your local RobotTestingProject-folder. The .bat script shall now follow the steps which is also visible in the log that is being opened. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the tests separately directly from your IDE

You must start the emulator and Appium Server manually first, 
use these commands: 

appium 

Open a new command prompt window and write: 

emulator -avd Medium_Phone_API_36 (or whichever emulator you have on your machine)

Dont close these two command windows after emulator and appium server is started. 

Now you can directly from your IDE click on the Start test-icon, or start the whole suite to run the tests.
